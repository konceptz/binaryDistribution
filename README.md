binaryDistribution
==================

A tool to get the distribution of ASCII characters from any file.


Also this returns the mean variation and standard deviation of the characters found.  

TODO
====

Find some way to include a smart analysis into what kind of file we have just checked.  

This could be a clue, or at least a path I can take.
