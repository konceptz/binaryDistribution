binaryDistribution
==================

A tool to get the distribution of ASCII characters from any file.


Also this returns the mean variation and standard deviation of the characters found.  

OUTPUT
======

This program will stupidly generate a list of all encountered ASCII values or show 0 for non-encountered values.  Which will give the user some overview as to what kind of file is being scanned.  

For example, a text file with _only_ lower case characters will show incremented values from 97-122.


TODO
====

Find some way to include a smart analysis into what kind of file we have just checked.  

This could be a clue, or at least a path I can take.
